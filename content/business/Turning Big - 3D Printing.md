Recently two of my friend have started 3D printing as business, Initially one of them was a hobbyist and then thought of starting a business around it. Here are what I would have done if I was the one running the business


## Brand Name is The Key
Nothing in this list will be possible without a brand name, company registration is not that important if you are making it indie way 
## Online Presence
Website for me is the biggest most important thing when running a business. How can people find you? Mostly through Website and Instagram. Website is a must

### Website 
If I am building a site, If I am a coder then I will try to find my own solution, which gives me control over payment methods, content shown, image types and overall aesthetics of the site. Maybe I would use Next.js with help of claude to setup the payment through Stripe/Razorpay.
If I don't know coding, then I would go for battle tested things like WordPress or Shopify, setting up a store and making it as aesthetic as possible, aesthetics sells in current times. 

### Content
for the content needed for the site, I will go on maker world and other 3D models site, spend hours identifying the models that has potential to sell big
maybe 10-15  models initially. I will print 2 of each of those models in different color and material, for the rest I would download the model and put different colors model
Maybe generate 2+5 images for each of those models for putting those on the site

### Custom requests
Charging more for custom request, section in site that let's them contact you write a small request as to what they want

## How to get noticed
Corporate gifting is okay but selling to interior designing studios could be the move
I see a lot of potential in collaborating with these design studios creating custom products for them. Could potentially bring handsome money
### Instagram
If I had a co-founder with content knowledge of what works and what doesn't , and if he's willing to create the content on Instagram could be the move. Reels give you unprecedented advantage. There are millions 3D printers in India, question is who is better at marketing them.
### Selling Kit
Make child friendly material toys and other Lego type building kits, Lego is generally costly in India, If you can print some good brain tinkering toys, many new generation parents are down to buy them even at a pretty good cost

### Product Catalog
Premium Home Decor Items - Cool lamps, other house hold items
R&D on new innovation of a new product 
Custom requests for Corporate gifting
Do It Yourself Kits

## Supply Management
Online orders will take 7-8 days, no cap. If needed fast pay more. No return policy only replacement for if sent back 5d

## Better Overall Management
I would be using a something shared workspace like Notion or anything equivalent. Inventory management, order statuses, progress in deals, payments, revenue and costs, units sold and replacement criteria, order dispatches, R&D prototypes 
Everything should be written, and so easily you can find anything in under 5 minutes of search. Should not be a hassle.

## Learn or Rent talent
Offer internship, people who knows how to create models on the go and edit them. You will both learn fast.

## Make up your mind
I would before going into all of these make up my mind if I really wanted to go all-in in this business/project. Motiavation and intentions matter most
